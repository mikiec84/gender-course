gender-course
=============

Repository containing code which reproduces the gender analysis on MIT/Harvard's Online Courses. This is a complement to my blog article [The Interesting Percentages of Female Students in MIT and Harvard Online Courses](http://minimaxir.com/2014/07/gender-course/).

Since MIT/Harvard prevent redistribution of the dataset, you'll have to [download the dataset](http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/26147) yourself to start the analysis.

Requires the *dplyr* R package.
